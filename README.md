# GameShop Engine

## Author: Lynden Jay Evans

I am making a Game Engine with LightWeight Java Game Library.  That Engine is called GameShop Engine.  Reasons for it I am explaining.  It is designed to provide 100 Year Advancement for Video Game Development.  I always knew it was capable of this.  I want it to Out Compete a system like Unreal Engine which for now has 20 Years Of Brilliance.  20 Years is a very long time that is something I can respect greatly.  100 Years is a Pinnacle that lasts a Lifetime.  It is rarely seen.

I would prefer Pay through Patreon.  It will come with a Patreon usage License.  Here is a DevLog:
